## Detect Inappropriate Content In Your Images
Use Yahoo Open NSFW to detect the possibility that your image is not suitable for work (pornographic content). Detection ranges from 0 to 100%.

Possible Use Cases:

- Automatically flag inappropriate content uploaded in your online community.
- Block inappropriate images from being loaded for a child-safe environment.
- Continue fine tuning this prediction model on your own dataset to detect a broader set of NSFW content.
